            I&apos;m Jan, {new Date().getFullYear() - 1992} year old software
            developer from Poland. I&apos;m that guy on the picture enjoying
            Thai Wake Park and trying to wakeboard for the first time - it was a
            blast! Anyways, back to serious stuff, during my business studies at
            college I got interested in building websites. After graduating I
            worked for roughly a year as a UX Project Manager in an e-commerce

            making great experiences, this time as a developer. Currently
            I&apos;m in Berlin, Germany, working as a Frontend Developer at{' '}
